# Data-Science-Project-Used-Cars
Final Project for STAT 1361 - Statistical Learning and Data Science

* Given a dataset of 2809 used cars, I used numerous regression and machine learning models to predict the selling price as accurately as possible. Some models used include forward selection with AIC and BIC, lasso regression, bagged regression trees, and a random forest model. The project was carried out entirely using R.
